OVERVIEW
--------

The original motivation of openModeller was to automate the tedious and
complex tasks involved in biological distribution modelling regarding 
map file formats, georeferencing issues, resamples, map interpolations, etc.
Some consequences arise from this automation:

a) One can spend time developing algorithms, testing, tunning or comparing
   results. To compare two or more different algorithms we need the same 
   input data, the same sample methodology, etc.

b) Different tasks can be performed by independent components in distributed
   frameworks. A framework could look for species data (in sources like 
   the GBIF portal) and for environmental data. These data are hard to find
   (with high quality) and some times are enormous.

c) Powerfull computers could be used to run heavy algorithms (like GARP) 
   and that could also be done in parallel (clustering).


CURRENT STATUS
--------------

- Core modelling interface implemented in c++ (control interface).
- Algorithms dinamically loaded as separate c++ libraries (algorithm
  interface).
- Simple command-line (console) interface.
- SOAP interface prototype.
- Desktop interface available as a plug-in to Quantum GIS.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

* Proj.4 (Cartographic Projections Library)
  http://remotesensing.org/proj/

* GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) version >= 1.1.9
  http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal

* to run the simple map viewer (om_viewer) libX11 is needed
  (tested with version 6.2)

* to run the CSM (Climate Space Model) algorithm the GSL (GNU
  Scientific Library) version >= 1.4 is needed

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

For now only Doxygen documentation is available.

Download Doxygen from: http://www.doxygen.org

In the main directory, run: make doc

Then have a look at the "html" or "latex" directories that
will be created.
