openModeller Acceptance Test Script
===================================

This directory contains a python script designed to perform extensive tests
on many of openModeller features to ensure its quality.

The tests should be run every time that significant changes have been made
to the code base as well as when new releases are being prepared.


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Here are some instructions on how to setup and run the tests:

1) Configure openModeller to build the Python interface. This can be done by
running the following commands on OM root directory:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-python
	make
	make install

2) Set your PYTHONPATH environmental variable to include Python site-packages
directory. In Linux Fedora 2 and Python 2.3, the default directory is:

	/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages

3) Run the tests with the command:

	./runtest.sh

First, the test script will download test data from 
http://openmodeller.cria.org.br/download/acc_test_data.tar.gz
Then it will untar it locally and run the full python test script on it.

Optionally, you can specify the directories containing tests you want to run. By default the script executes all tests in "./algs" directory.

A sample test script can be found in ./samples.

4) The test will run and results will be output to html reports in the file:

	index.html

That page shows a summary of test results. There is a link to a second 
html page that shows the actual maps generated during the tests side by 
side to sample of expected results.

One would browse through the maps visually comparing actual results
agains expected samples.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

This version of the test script accepts no command line options.


CURRENT STATUS
--------------

- Need to add expected results images;
 
- Need to add those tests to autotools setup. That would include a separate
make action, that in turn would include automatic download and extraction 
of test datasets. The test would require python interface to be enabled. 



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------

Many thanks to Peter Brewer and A. Townsend Peterson for contributing with
some of the datasets used in this test script.
