  <title>openModeller CLI Introduction</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Using openModeller command-line tools on Windows</h1>

<p>You have installed the openModeller command-line interface (CLI).
openModeller is a modular software and there are different ways to use its
core functionality. If you are interested in a graphical user
interface (GUI) with buttons, controls and images you should download a
different software package called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openmodeller/files/openModeller%20Desktop/">openModeller Desktop</a>. 
Instead, if you want to learn and use the CLI interface, the package 
you have just installed offers tools (commands) that provide a similar 
funcionality to openModeller Desktop, except for the visualization facilities. 
In this case, you can use a geographical information system, such as 
<a href="http://qgis.org">Quantum GIS</a>, to visualize your data.</p>

<p>This document is not intended to be a
replacement for the manual pages nor for the <a href="http://openmodeller.sf.net/documentation.html">documentation available
in the openModeller website</a>. This is just a quick introduction about
the openModeller command line tools including an example of how to 
generate a simple model.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>Command line tools run on a <i>terminal</i>. On Windows, the
<i>terminal</i> is the <i>Command prompt</i>, also known as the MS-DOS
prompt. Starting from openModeller 1.3.0, the installer includes
shortcuts in the <i>Start menu</i> to all openModeller commands available 
in this environment (there are a couple of additional commands that are only 
available under GNU/Linux). When you click on any of these shortcuts, a new 
terminal is opened called <i>openModeller Terminal</i>, which is basically a 
standard <i>Command prompt</i> configured to automatically run the associated 
command line tool without any parameters, forcing the tool to output usage help. 
This output is basically the set of parameters required to effectively use the tool.</p>

<p>The <i>openModeller Terminal</i> starts in the <i>Working Folder</i>
specified during installation (the default is <code>C:\om</code>). Inside that folder, 
there is another folder called <i>examples</i> containing a couple of environmental 
layers, a file with point data and an example of a request file used to generate models.</p>

<h2>Generating a model</h2>

<p>From now on, the commands you should type to reproduce the example are in <b>bold</b>, 
while the content in <code>monospaced</code> font shows the output from the terminal itself
and/or openModeller. We assume the <i>Working Folder</i> to be the default <code>C:\om</code>.</p> 

<p>Click on the om_console shortcut in the <i>Start menu</i> to get into the prompt, and then 
enter the examples directory:</p>

<p><code>
    C:\om&gt; <b>cd examples</b><br>
    C:\om\examples&gt;
</code></p>

<p>To generate a model with om_console you just need to provide a single parameter, which is a request file actually containing all possible parameters for this task. Use the request file provided as example:</p>

<p><code>
C:\om\examples&gt; <b>om_console request.txt</b><br>

C:\om\examples&gt; <br>
</code></p>

<p>That's it. If you open <i>request.txt</i> at <code>C:\om\examples</code> with a text editor you will see all parameters that were used in the modelling procedure, including the file with point data, the environmental layers used for model creation and model projection and so on. As a result you get the openModeller serialized model in XML (in this case furcata.xml) and the projected model (furcata.img) that you can open in a GIS that supports this format (which is ERDAS Imagine). Note that you can also change that format in the request if you want to produce a GeoTiff or an ARC/Info ASCII Grid instead.</p>

<p>In order to produce models with your own data, you can create a copy of <i>request.txt</i>, edit the new file and then run the same command passing the new file as a parameter.</p>
