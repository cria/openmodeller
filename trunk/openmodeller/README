OVERVIEW
--------

The original goal of openModeller was to automate the tedious and complex 
tasks involved in biological distribution modelling regarding map file 
formats, georeference issues, resamples, map interpolations, etc. Some 
consequences arise from this automation:

a) One can spend time developing algorithms, testing, tunning or comparing
   results. To compare two or more different algorithms we need the same 
   input data, the same sample methodology, etc.

b) Different tasks can be performed by independent components in distributed
   frameworks. A framework could look for species data (in sources like 
   the GBIF portal) and for environmental data. These data are hard to find
   (with high quality) and some times are enormous.

c) Powerfull computers could be used to run heavy algorithms (like GARP) 
   and it could also be done in parallel (clustering).


CURRENT STATUS
--------------

We started to build the server of a client-server version. A simple
command line interface (om_console) is already available and included in this
package. There's also a free desktop client, "Gyps", being developed by Tim
Sutton. See: http://www.sf.net/projects/gyps
The next step is to define a protocol, and build a distributed version 
probably using webServices. This way we will be able to share data and 
machine resources.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

* Proj.4 (Cartographic Projections Library)
  http://remotesensing.org/proj/

* GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) version >= 1.1.9
  http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal

* to run the simple map viewer (om_viewer) you'll need libX11
  (tested with version 6.2)


INSTALLATION
------------
See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build 
openModeler under Linux/Unix and INSTALL.win file for windows.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

For now only Doxygen documentation is available.

Download Doxygen from: http://www.doxygen.org

In the main directory, run: make doc

Then have a look at the "html" or "latex" directories that
will be created.
