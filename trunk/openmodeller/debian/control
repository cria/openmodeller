Description:  openModeller is an open source C++ static spatial distribution 
 modelling library which is mainly being used to predict species distribution 
 (fundamental niche). Models are generated by algorithms that receive as 
 input a set of occurrence points (longitude/latitude/abundance) and a 
 set of raster files. Models can then be projected into different 
 environments (different sets of raster files) to generate distribution 
 maps. Available algorithms include Bioclim, GARP (with best subset 
 procedure), CSM (Climate Space Model), and cartesian distance algorithms. 
 New algorithms can easily be added. The library uses GDAL to read 
 different raster formats and proj4 to convert between different 
 coordinate systems and projections. A console interface is distributed 
 with the library, as well as a SWIG wrapper for the Python language and 
 a SOAP server prototype. The tool was originally developed by CRIA as 
 part of the speciesLink project (funded by Fapesp, the State of Sao 
 Paulo Research Foundation).
