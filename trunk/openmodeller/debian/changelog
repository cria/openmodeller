  * New console application om_algorithm replaces om_metadump.
  * New Maximum Entropy algorithm.
  * Changed input range of the GARP Best Subsets TrainingProportion parameter from 0-1 to 0-100 (percentage) and included explanation about differences between old and new GARP implementations in the algorithm description.
  * Re-enabled max threads parameter in GARP Best Subsets.

libopenmodeller (0.5.3) feisty; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug when GDAL failed to read a raster row (in which case the row used to have zero values). Now the row is filled with nodata values.
  * XML request for model creation now supports additional options to filter occurrences (using spatiallyUnique or environmentallyUnique sampler functions).
  * Changed nodata value of the default raster type (ByteHFA) to 101.
  * Masks must now use nodata to indicate masked areas (zeros will not work anymore).
  * om_testmodel now generates pseudo-absence points when there are no absences to be tested.
  * Display confusion matrix cell values in om_console and om_testmodel.
  * Renamed getLayerFilename to getLayerPath and getMaskFilename to getMaskPath in EnvironmentPtr class.
  * Refactored om_pseudo, om_create and om_project to use the getopts command line library.
  * Created man pages for om_pseudo, om_create and om_project.
  * New parameter in om_pseudo to speficy the proportion of absence points to be generated.
  * New algorithm AquaMaps (for marine organisms).
  * Removed algorithms minimum distance and distance to average since EnvironmentalDistance provides the same functionality.
  * "type" property of AlgParamMetadata changed from char * to a new enumeration called AlgParamDatatype. Values can be Integer, Real and String.
  * Fixed bug in the environmental distance algorithm: probabilities were negative for points whose distance to the nearest point was beyond the maximum allowed distance. 
  * New classes to perform jackknife and chi-square in the environmental layers.
  * Updated TerraLib drivers for compatibility with TerraLib version 3.2.0.
