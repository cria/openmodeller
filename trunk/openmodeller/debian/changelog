libopenmodeller (1.1.0-0) karmic; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: Interquartile and envelope size adjustments were using wrong reference values for salinity and temperature in the Aquamaps algorithm.
  * Bugfix: All GARP algorithms were crashing when the abundance value associated with one of the occurrence points had more than two digits in the integer part.
  * Increased the default number of neurons in the hidden layer of the ANN algorithm.
  * New argument "s" in om_niche allowing model outputs to be scaled.
  * Re-implemented and re-enabled Maximum entropy algorithm based on the well-known Maxent.
  * Changed environmental distance algorithm forcing the Mahalanobis distance to use an identity matrix as the covariance matrix when there's only one input point.
  * Fixed small logical error in the CSM algorithm that could affect models with a large number of layers.
  * New algorithm (Niche Mosaic) implemented by Dr. Missae Yamamoto.
  * New algorithm (ENFA) kindly implemented by Dr. Chris Yesson.

libopenmodeller (1.0.0-0) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Changed ANN algorithm to avoid exceeding a maximum number of iterations when training by minimum error (parameter Epoch can be used for this purpose).
  * Added missing parameter serialization in SVM (the C parameter in the SVC method).
  * Added new method in the ConfusionMatrix class to use the lowest probability among the training presences as the threshold.
  * Changed the modelling protocol to allow createModel and testModel requests to specify what statistics should be calculated.
  * Removed model statistics parameters from om_model since they can be specified as part of the XML request.
  * All command line programs now return the same openModeller version number.
  * Changed om_niche parameters (now using getops) and created a man page for it.
  * Implemented custom log file in the modelling server.
  * ROC curve was not including (0,0) when background points were being generated, therefore producing lower AUC values.
  * Added more precision to partial AUC through interpolation.
  * Disabled the experimental maximum entropy algorithm.

libopenmodeller (0.7.0-3) gutsy; urgency=low

  * First attempt to generate Gutsy package.

libopenmodeller (0.7.0) hardy; urgency=low

  * New Algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks.
  * Changed AUC calculation when no absence points are provided (instead of using 1-specificity after generating pseudo-absences, it now uses the proportion of points predicted present for a large number of random background points).
  * Included method to calculate partial area ratio in ROC class.
  * Added parameters --calc-matrix, --calc-roc, --num-background and --max-omission to om_test.
  * Changed confusion matrix serialization to store all raw values.
  * Included new map format to generate ARC/Info ASCII grid files (byte or floating point fomats).
  * Fixed bug in Maximum Entropy algorithm (environment was being re-normalized when pseudo-absences were generated internally).
  * Added support to handle categorical values in the Maximum Entropy algorithm.
  * Fixed bug in ROC curve calculation: when the corresponding algorithm required normalization and the sampler passed as a parameter was unnormalized, algorithm prediction values were being calculated based on unnormalized samples.
  * Added support to use "Spatially unique" and Environmentally unique" keywords in the request file (console interface).

libopenmodeller (0.6.1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Enabled integration with Condor in the modelling server.
  * Added new method in the modelling service to perform external tests.
  * Renamed om_testmodel to om_test. The new version is using getopts and accepts XML requests. A man page was also created.
  * Renamed om_create to om_model.
  * Renamed om_sampledump to om_sampler, which now accepts txt or xml input files.
  * Removed om_dump (its functionality was incorporated by the new om_sampler).
  * Added new parameter in om_points to split points into test/training with a given proportion.
  * Added new parameters in the Maximum Entropy algorithm to treat layer values in a different way (feature types).
  * Changed om_niche to receive a serialized model as a parameter.

libopenmodeller (0.6.0) hardy; urgency=low

  * New driver to read point data from TAPIR/DarwinCore providers.
  * New driver to read point data from GBIF.
  * New driver to read point data from serialized openModeller objects (XML).
  * New generic API for pre-analysis.
  * New console application om_algorithm replaces om_metadump.
  * New Maximum Entropy algorithm.
  * Changed input range of the GARP Best Subsets TrainingProportion parameter from 0-1 to 0-100 (percentage) and included explanation about differences between old and new GARP implementations in the algorithm description.
  * Re-enabled max threads parameter in GARP Best Subsets.
  * Removed automake files (now completely replaced by cmake).
  * Renamed compiled constant that can be used to indicate the location of algorithms from OM_LIB_PATH to OM_ALG_PATH.

libopenmodeller (0.5.3) feisty; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug when GDAL failed to read a raster row (in which case the row used to have zero values). Now the row is filled with nodata values.
  * XML request for model creation now supports additional options to filter occurrences (using spatiallyUnique or environmentallyUnique sampler functions).
  * Changed nodata value of the default raster type (ByteHFA) to 101.
  * Masks must now use nodata to indicate masked areas (zeros will not work anymore).
  * om_testmodel now generates pseudo-absence points when there are no absences to be tested.
  * Display confusion matrix cell values in om_console and om_testmodel.
  * Renamed getLayerFilename to getLayerPath and getMaskFilename to getMaskPath in EnvironmentPtr class.
  * Refactored om_pseudo, om_create and om_project to use the getopts command line library.
  * Created man pages for om_pseudo, om_create and om_project.
  * New parameter in om_pseudo to speficy the proportion of absence points to be generated.
  * New algorithm AquaMaps (for marine organisms).
  * Removed algorithms minimum distance and distance to average since EnvironmentalDistance provides the same functionality.
  * "type" property of AlgParamMetadata changed from char * to a new enumeration called AlgParamDatatype. Values can be Integer, Real and String.
  * Fixed bug in the environmental distance algorithm: probabilities were negative for points whose distance to the nearest point was beyond the maximum allowed distance. 
  * New classes to perform jackknife and chi-square in the environmental layers.
  * Updated TerraLib drivers for compatibility with TerraLib version 3.2.0.
