NAME
       om_viewer - Command line tool to visualize the environmental layers and projected model based on an openModeller request file

SYNOPSIS
       om_viewer [-r] REQUEST_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       om_viewer is a quick alternative to visualize either the environmental layers used in model creation or the corresponding projected model given an openModeller request file. If you have a request file compatible with om_console(1) you can use this tool to look at the input points and environmental layers. After running om_console(1) against the same request file, use the same tool with the -r parameter to visualize the projected model. Note: om_viewer depends on X11.

OPTIONS
       -r       Visualize only the projected model. Omit this parameter to visualize all input layers used in model creation sequentially.
