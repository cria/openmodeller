OO Command Line Parser -- v0.2.0 (http://www.dragon-ware.com/~steve/getopts)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OO Command Line Parser is a little project that I did to redo
my getopts replacement, but to use C++ and do it in an object
oriented fashion.  

To see how it works,

g++ -c getopts.C sample/main.C
g++ -o getopts *.o

Now that it's compiled you can run it.
./getopts -h  will show the help (or use --help)

sample/main.C should be pretty straight forward for your own projects that
I shouldn't need to write more here.  So I won't.

TODO:
o Better documentation
o Proper output of showHelp()

BUGS:

o 20010610 -- None that I know of (SAM)
