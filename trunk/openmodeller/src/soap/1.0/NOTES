- To change anything in the OMWS interface it is necessary
  to have gSOAP installed. The API is defined in om_soap.hh.

- To generate the SOAP stubs and skeletons use:
 
  soapcpp2 om_soap.hh

- If you are upgrading gSOAP, don't forget to overwrite 
  stdsoap2.cpp and stdsoap2.h with the newer versions.
  They have to be manually copied to this directory.

- To activate server debug logging, uncomment the line
  #define DEBUG in stdsoap2.h and recompile the server.
