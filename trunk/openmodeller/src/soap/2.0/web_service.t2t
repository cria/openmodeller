= Introduction =

This document describes the openModeller web service interface
(OMWS) version 2.0. OMWS was created so that the main ecological niche modelling
functionalities provided by [openModeller http://openmodeller.sf.net] 
(Muñoz //et al.// 2011) could be available in a standardized way over 
the web to other programs. Therefore the target audience for this document 
are developers interested in writing programs to interact with an OMWS 
server or perhaps in implementing a new OMWS server. It is assumed 
that readers have basic understanding about 
[ecological niche modelling http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_niche_modelling], 
basic understanding of openModeller and knowledge about web services.

= Acknowledgements =

The previous version of this document ([OMWS 1.0 web_service.html])
was originally prepared for the [BioVeL http://www.biovel.eu/] project
with funds from the [European Commission http://ec.europa.eu]. The new
version of the protocol was mostly developed as part of the
[EUBrazilOpenBio project http://eubrazilopenbio.eu] with funds from
[CNPq http://cnpq.br] and the European Commission, although some of the
changes in the new version originated from BioVeL.

= Technical details =

OMWS is based on [SOAP http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/] following the 
document/literal style and the interface is programatically defined 
in [WSDL http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl]:

http://openmodeller.cria.org.br/ws/2.0/openModeller.wsdl

The main [XML http://www.w3.org/XML/] elements, attributes, structure 
and data types used inside the SOAP Body are defined in a separate 
[XML Schema www.w3.org/XML/Schema] compatible with openModeller 
serializable objects:

http://openmodeller.cria.org.br/xml/2.0/openModeller.xsd

= Software =

Although most operations and XML data structures remained the same in
version 2.0, the two protocol versions are not backwards compatible,
as they have different namespaces. This means that clients developed
for the 1.0 version will not be able to communicate with servers
developed for the 2.0 version and vice versa. However, the necessary
changes for an existing client to become compatible with the new
version are //usually// minimal (essentially just change the protocol
and the openModeller schema namespaces).

So far there are two known server implementations of the service 
compatible with this version. One of them ([oM Server om_server_2.html]) was 
developed in C++ using [gSOAP http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html]
and is part of the openModeller code under the //src/soap/2.0// directory since
openModeller version 1.4. oM Server contains stubs generated by gSOAP that 
can also be used by other developers willing to write clients in C++.

The other implementation was developed by the [Polytechnic Univerty of Valencia http://www.upv.es] and 
the [Barcelona Supercomputing Centre http://www.bsc.es] in order to exploit 
[COMP Superscalar http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/grid-computing/comp-superscalar] 
workflow management capabilities in the backend. This implementation was
developed in Java, although it also depends on openModeller command-line 
tools, as oM Server does. Source code can be found in the [EUBrazilOpenBio Subversion repository https://svn.d4science-ii.research-infrastructures.eu/gcube/trunk/application/EcologicalNicheModelling/ecological-niche-modelling/].

There is also a simple command-line client that can be found in the 
openModeller source code at //src/soap/2.0/sampleClient.pl//. It is written 
in Perl and depends on the [SOAPLite Perl module http://www.soaplite.com/].

= Service instances =

Currently the following instance is publicly available:

http://modeller.cria.org.br/ws2/om

Reminder: you need a SOAP client to properly interact with this URL.

= Interaction with the service =

Although the number of operations available on the service is
relatively small, there are many different ways to use them. Figure 1
shows a typical workflow as an example. Some people may be interested
only in the models - without even testing of projecting them. Others
may want to project a model only if a previous test indicates that the
results are good enough. Even model creation may be conditioned by previous
tests involving preliminary models created with different subsets of
input data (through n-fold cross validation, for instance). Multiple
projections can also be requested when there is more than one
environmental scenario available.

[img/ws_diagram_2_small.png]

**Figure 1:** Typical workflow to interact with the service. Boxes
  with solid lines indicate calls to service operations. Boxes with
  dashed lines indicate external tasks, except those indicating the
  summarized "getProgress" procedure.

It is important to note that a "model" for openModeller is the
mathemathical representation of the ecological niche. If we take a
simple algorithm like Bioclim for example, the model will be the
bioclimatic envelopes and the logic that says that inside the inner
envelope the environmental conditions are suitable (corresponding to
the numerical value 1), inside the marginal envelope the environmental
conditions can still be considered acceptable (corresponding to 0.5)
and outiside the marginal envelope the environmental conditions are
unsuitable (corresponding to 0). You can graphical examples of Bioclim
models [here algorithms/bioclim.html]. Therefore, the [createModel #toc31] 
operation will request the creation of that kind of model -
not a map!  The result of "getModel" will be the serialized model,
which in the case of Bioclim will be just the bioclimatic envelopes
(minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation cutoff for each
variable, as can be seen in the [getModel example response #toc36]). 
Two things are usually done with a model in OMWS: it can be
tested as many times as necessary (getting back statistical results as
a confusion matrix and/or ROC curve) or it can be projected into a
geographic region given an environmental scenario. This can also be
done as many times as necessary. The result of a model projection is
finally the potential distribution map in the form of a georeferenced
raster.

As can be seen, OMWS is centered around a few core operations for
ecological niche modelling, not covering other related things such as
data cleaning, splitting points into test/training, pre-analysis on
input data, post processing distribution maps, etc. Nevertheless,
these core operations can still be used and combined in many different
ways, keeping the interface simple and effective.

Another important thing to mention is that, in this new version of the
protocol, many parts of the workflow described in figure 1 can be
encapsulated into a single runExperiment call, leaving the workflow
management to the server side.

= Changes from version 1.0 to 2.0 =

- Internal tests must now be performed by means of a separate testModel
  call (the <Statistics> parameter was removed from createModel 
  requests).
- getProgress now accepts a comma separated list of
  tickets, returning a comma separated list of progresses.
- New progress code -3 to indicate cancelled jobs.
- New progress code -4 to indicate unknown jobs.
- New "samplePoints" operation that can be used to randomly sample
  points in a given region & environmental scenario. This operation 
  is followed by the corresponding "getSamplingResult" operation.
- New "evaluateModel" operation that can be used to retrieve raw
  model values for a given set of points in a given environmental
  scenario. This operation is followed by the corresponding 
  "getModelEvaluation" operation.
- New "cancel" operation, accepting a comma separated list of job
  tickets.
- New "runExperiment" operation that can be used to run several jobs
  with dependencies between them, allowing backend implementations to
  take care of the workflow using parallelization techniques. This
  operation is followed by the corresponding "getResults" operation.


= Additional notes =

All XML content used in the examples was formatted for better
visualization. In some cases the content was deliberately shortened to
avoid displaying dozens of algorithms and hundreds of layers in the
examples. Despite these changes, all XML messages can be seen as real
and functional examples of how to interact with the service.

Each server implementation must raise a SOAP fault if it cannot
fulfill a request. SOAP faults are specific to each implementation
and therefore are not covered by this document.

= Operations =

== ping ==

=== Description ===

Indicates service availability. In a broader sense, service
availability is not just related with connectivity. It also involves
correct configuration on the server side. Server implementations can
therefore use this method to check as much as possible that the server
is prepared to properly handle all requests. Clients must get a
<status>1</status> if the service is available - otherwise a SOAP fault
is raised. Additionally, server implementations may use the <version>
element in the header to indicate their name and version.

This is the right operation for service monitoring.

== getAlgorithms ==

=== Description ===

Returns metadata about all modelling algorithms available on the
server. Metadata includes id, version, name, overview, description,
designers, bibliography, developers, an indicator if the algorithm can
handle categorical data, an indicator if it requires absence data, and
parameters. Parameter metadata includes id, name, data type (Integer,
Real or String), overview, description, accepted range and default
value. Algorithm and parameter ids are used to reference them in the
other operations.

In the current openModeller version all textual content is
in English. When displaying algorithm metadata on user interfaces,
descriptions of both algorithms and parameters are particularly
important. For an algorithm, this may contain crucial information
about how to run it, as in the case of AquaMaps, which requires a
particular set of environmental layers to work. In other cases,
descriptions may help to understand the differences between two
implementations of the same algorithm, such as Desktop GARP and oM
GARP, or they may contain additional information about the status of
the algorithm and the conditions in which it can be used. For
parameters, in many cases descriptions contain the possible values
with additional explanations.

An algorithm may have zero, one or more parameters. EnvelopeScore is
an example of an algorithm without any parameters. Parameter metadata
can optionally indicate an accepted range, with minimum and maximum
values (both can be present, or at least one of them).

Different service instances are not guaranteed to provide the same
algorithms or the same versions of each algorithm, unless there is a
specific policy in this respect controlling the different instances.

          <Overview>Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods that belong to 
a family of generalized linear classifiers. They can also be considered a special case of Tikhonov regularization. 
A special property of SVMs is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical classification error and maximize the 
geometric margin; hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers. Content retrieved from Wikipedia on the 
13th of June, 2007: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Support_vector_machine&amp;oldid=136646498.
          </Overview>
          <Description>Support vector machines map input vectors to a higher dimensional space where a maximal 
separating hyperplane is constructed. Two parallel hyperplanes are constructed on each side of the hyperplane that 
separates the data. The separating hyperplane is the hyperplane that maximises the distance between the two parallel 
hyperplanes. An assumption is made that the larger the margin or distance between these parallel hyperplanes the 
better the generalisation error of the classifier will be. The model produced by support vector classification only 
depends on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model does not care about 
training points that lie beyond the margin. Content retrieved from Wikipedia on the 13th of June, 2007: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Support_vector_machine&amp;oldid=136646498. The openModeller implementation 
of SVMs makes use of the libsvm library version 2.85: Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin, LIBSVM: a library for support 
vector machines, 2001. Software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm.

of Bioclim described in Pineiro et al (2007).

== getLayers ==

=== Description ===

Returns all environmental layers available on the server side. Layers
can be grouped and organized in a hierarchical structure by means of
<LayersGroup> elements. This response format was explicitly designed
to allow clients to browse remote layers in the same same they would
do by inspecting the local file system looking for raster files.

Each layer group and each individual layer has an id and a label. Ids
are used to reference layers in the other operations. An optional
layer attribute (HasProjection) can be used to indicate that there is
no geographical projection information available for the layer. In
such cases, the server must assume a latlong projection with the WGS84
datum when reading data from the corresponding layer.

The protocol does not include operations to manipulate layers (add or
remove files, or edit metadata). These tasks need to be performed on
the server side by other means. For this reason, and considering that
there are lots of layers available everywhere, server implementations
may additionally support references to external layers, either
downloadable through URLs used as identifiers or through WCS layer
identifiers following the pattern:

wcs>wcs_service_url>coverage_id

However, supporting access to external layers is not mandatory on the
protocol. Service providers may prefer to only allow access to local
layers advertised through this operation, or to a specific white list
of external data providers. Clients must contact or test the data
provider before counting on such functionality.

Different service instances are not guaranteed to provide the same
layers, unless there is a specific policy in this
respect. Additionally, a service instance may not keep the same layer
structure or even the identifiers for all layers over the time -
again, unless there is a specific policy with this purpose.

== samplePoints ==

=== Description ===

Randomly sample the specified number of points on the specified
environmental scenario. The scenario requires a set of layers
referenced by their ids and a mask (which is also a layer) referenced
by its id. The mask is used to discard points outside its extent or
inside cells with nodata.

A mandatory section <Options> is used to indicate the number of points
(NumPoints) to be sampled, an optional label for the points (usually
a species name) and the proportion of absences (0 meaning only
presences, 1 meaning only absences and intermediate values meaning a
mix between them). Optional subelements can be used to instruct the
service to sample only <SpatiallyUnique/> points (discarding points
with the same coordinates) and/or <EnvironmentallyUnique/> points
(discarding points with the same environmental conditions).

This operation is asynchronous. It immediately returns a ticket that 
must be used to track job progress later.

== getProgress ==

=== Description ===

Returns the progress of one or more jobs of any type (sampling points,
model creation, model testing, model evaluation or model
projection). Multiple jobs can be specified by a comma separated list
of tickets. In that case, a comma separated list of progresses will be
returned in the same order. Possible values for an individual progress
are: -1 if the job is still queued, -2 if the job was aborted, -3 if
the job was cancelled, -4 is the job is unknown, a value between 0 and
100 if the job is in progress or 100 if the job was finished. More
details about aborted jobs can be discovered with the [getLog #toc25]
operation.

== createModel ==

=== Description ===

Starts a new model creation job. This requires a set of layers
referenced by their ids, a mask referenced by its id, a set of
presence points (samples where the environment is suitable for the
species), an optional set of absence points (samples where the
environment is unsuitable for the species), a modelling algorithm
referenced by its id and, if the algorithm requires parameters, a set
of parameters referenced by ids and followed by a value.

Each set of points needs a spatial reference system specified in 
[WKT http://www.geoapi.org/3.0/javadoc/org/opengis/referencing/doc-files/WKT.html].
Example 7 shows the WKT for latlong in WGS84. Longitude and latitude 
are represented by X and Y, respectively, and decimals must always be 
separated by a dot. An identification for each point is highly recommended, 
as points are referenced by it in the logs. A label for each set of 
points can be used to indicate the species name. This information is not 
used by the server, but it is returned later as part of the model created
and can be a way to keep record of which species was modelled. 

An optional section <Options> can be used to instruct the server to
apply filters in the points before they are used. <SpatiallyUnique/>

<EnvironmentallyUnique/> is used to discard points with the same
environmental conditions.

This operation is asynchronous. It immediately returns a ticket that 
must be used to track job progress later.

== getModel ==

=== Description ===

Returns a created model, which includes all parameters that were used
to generate the model. Note in the response example that the
<Algorithm> element now includes a <Model> element with the actual
result of the modelling process for that particular algorithm. This
element contains all necessary information for algorithm predictions
given an environmental scenario. Each algorithm has its own unique XML
representation which is not part of this protocol. This XML
representation must be, however, sufficient to be used in subsequent
calls to other operations that require a model as a parameter.

Model testing, projection and evaluation require the <Algorithm> section
returned by this operation.

=== Description ===

Evaluates a model on a given set of points in a given environmental
scenario. Unlike the testModel operation, this operation is only
intended to return the raw model values for each point.

This operation is asynchronous. It immediately returns a ticket that 
must be used to track job progress later.

== testModel ==

=== Description ===

Starts a new model testing job. This requires an environmental scenario
(set of layers including a mask), a set of presence points, an
optional set of absence points, a model (<Algorithm> element returned
by the [createModel #toc31] operation), and statistics parameters.

Statistics may include confusion matrix and ROC curve. A threshold can
be specified for the confusion matrix. The "IgnoreAbsences" attribute
can be used discard absence points in the calculations, in case they
were passed as background points (in openModeller, some algorithms
that require background points, like Maxent, have a parameter that
allows users to specify the background points through absences).

Two approaches can be used to calculate ROC curves. The first one is
the traditional approach which requires presence and absence
points. The second was proposed by Phillips //et al.// (2006) to
handle presence-only data using the proportional predicted area that
can be approximated by means of background points. When only presences
are available, the second approach must be used used and the attribute
"BackgroundPoints" is available to specify the number of background
points to be generated (on its absence, the default 10000 must be
assumed). Background points can also be specified by the user by means
of absences. In this case the attribute "UseAbsencesAsBackground" must
be 1. In both approaches the resolution (number of points in the
curve) and a maximum accepted ommision can be specified. Maximum
omission is used to calculate partial ROC curves, according to
Peterson //et al.// (2008).

This operation is asynchronous. It immediately returns a ticket that 
must be used to track job progress later.

== projectModel ==

=== Description ===

Starts a new model projection job. This includes a model (<Algorithm>
section returned by the [createModel #toc31] operation), an environmental
scenario (set of layers with an output mask indicating the extent of
the projection) and additional output parameters. If the environmental
scenario is the same as the one used in model creation, this is known
as a native projection. If the scenario is different, the number of
layers must be the same and the corresponding variables must also be
in the same order used for model creation.

Output parameters include a template layer whose spatial resolution
and spatial reference system are used to create the distribution
map, and a file type with the possible values:

|| Id          | Format and range                   | Nodata value |
| GreyTiff     | Grey scale GeoTiff [0,254]         | 255          |
| GreyTiff100  | Grey scale GeoTiff [0,100]         | 127          |
| FloatingTiff | Floating point GeoTiff             | -1           |
| GreyBMP      | Grey scale BMP [0,255]             | 0            |
| FloatingHFA  | Floating point Erdas Imagine       | -1           |
| ByteHFA      | Byte Erdas Imagine [0,100]         | 101          |
| ByteASC      | Byte ARC/Info ASCII grid [0,100]   | 101          |
| FloatingASC  | Floating point ARC/Info ASCII grid | -9999        |

An optional <Statistics> section can be used to specify the threshold
to calculate the number of cells considered suitable for the species
occurrence. This information can be retrieved through the
[getProjectionMetadata #toc55] operation.

This operation is asynchronous. It immediately returns a ticket that 
must be used to track job progress later.

== runExperiment ==

=== Description ===

This operation can be used to specify multiple jobs of the following
types: sampling points, model creation, model testing or model
projection. Dependencies can be established between:

- Points for model creation or model testing (presence and/or absence) 
  and the result of sampling points jobs;
- Models for testing or projection jobs and the result of model 
  creation jobs.


The idea is to allow a whole workflow to be specified in a single
request rather than invoking the service multiple times through
individual calls. Although it should be possible to use this operation
to make individual calls (such as a single model creation job), it is 
recommended to use the corresponding individual operation to avoid 
possible additional processing due to workflow control mechanisms that
may be in place on the server side.

Requests are structured in the following way: An initial section is
used to specify the basic parameters used by any job, including:
environmental layers, presence and/or absence points, algorithm
settings and models. Each basic parameter has an identifier ("id") in
its main element. This section is then followed by one or more job
specifications, which may reference existing parameters or jobs
through the "idref" attribute. When a job is referenced, the result of
the referenced job should be used as the corresponding parameter,
indicating a dependency relationship between the two jobs.

This operation can also be useful even when there are no dependencies
between jobs, for example when multiple models need to be created for
the same species using several algorithms, or for multiple species
using the same algorithm.

The response is a series of tickets, one for each job.

%In this case, "lpt" can be used to
%instruct the server to use the lowest presence threshold (lowest
%prediction among training points).
