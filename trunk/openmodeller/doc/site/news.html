<H2>Three projects improving openModeller</H2>

<P>
Thursday, 31 May 2012
</P>
<P>
In general, programmers are not good at advertising their work as they are always busy implementing new things, fixing bugs, interacting with users and writing reports. So, the fact that you don't see any news here for some time doesn't mean that there's no activity going on. Actually, right now there are many exciting activities related to openModeller being carried out. This post gives you an overview of what's happening.  There are currently three projects promoting specific improvements in openModeller. An extension to the <A HREF="http://inct.florabrasil.net">INCT</A> - Virtual Herbarium funded by the Brazilian government will soon release a web application to generate niche models for species of the Brazilian Flora. The Random Forests algorithm (already released in version 1.2) was implemented as part of this project. In this new system, all models will be generated by openModeller, but this effort will actually be carried out in a partnership with another project called <A HREF="http://www.eubrazilopenbio.eu/">EUBrazil-OpenBio</A>. This second project is being jointly funded by the Brazilian government and the European Commission, and it involves several institutions from both sides. It has the ambitious goal of creating a Virtual Research Environment offering access to biodiversity data and tools, including niche modelling. In this particular case, the main idea is to investigate different ways of efficiently running openModeller on the Cloud, including parallelization strategies. It will also develop an advanced web interface (similar to openModeller Desktop) to generate niche models. The same project is also funding a new implementation of the Maximum Entropy algorithm in openModeller.  Preliminary results look promising (you can check <A HREF="http://wiki.eubrazilopenbio.eu/index.php/OpenModeller_Maxenta">here</A>), indicating that we will finally be able to produce similar results to the original Maxent software. The third project, <A HREF="http://www.biovel.eu/">BioVeL</A>, is entirely funded by the European Commission.  CRIA is participating with many European institutions. Here, the main idea is to enhance existing tools and services so that researchers can use a workflow management tool (in this case <A HREF="http://www.taverna.org.uk/">Taverna</A>) to design and run complex tasks related to bioinformatics and biodiversity informatics.  BioVeL will promote many improvements in the openModeller Web Service inteface including not just functionality but also documentation and tests. We already managed to run the first niche modelling workflows and we hope to soon release them to the public.

<H2>How to add new algorithms in openModeller</H2>

<P>
Monday, 06 October 2008
</P>
<P>
A new document is available to help those who are interested in adding new algorithms in openModeller. All algorithms must be written in C++.  Apart from that, the framework is quite flexible to accommodate new algorithms since they are completely free to decide how distribution models will be represented. The new manual is available <A HREF="http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/alg_manual.html">here</A>. 
</P>

<H2>openModeller being used by the GBIF data portal</H2>

<P>
Wednesday, 20 August 2008
</P>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</A> (GBIF) recently released a new version of its <A HREF="http://data.gbif.org/">data portal</A> allowing users to generate niche models in real time. After searching for occurrence records, users have the option to create a niche model when visualizing results.  
</P>
<P>
The data portal uses a Java client that can communicate with a remote modelling service through the openModeller Web Service protocol (OMWS).  The Java client was developed by the <A HREF="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado</A>, and the modelling service by <A HREF="http://www.cria.org.br/">CRIA</A>. Initially, models are being generated only for present time using the Envelope Score algorithm.  
</P>
<P>
GBIF is the world largest biodiversty data portal, currently serving more than 140 million specimen/observation records of which 80% are georeferrenced.
</P>

<H2>Version 0.6.0 of the openModeller library released</H2>

<P>
Tuesday, 08 July 2008
</P>
<P>
Version 0.6.0 of the openModeller library is now available. This release
contains mainly new features, including:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Drivers to directly read occurrences from GBIF or TAPIR/DarwinCore providers.
<LI>A new command-line tool (om_points) that can be used to retrieve occurrence data using any of the available drivers.
<LI>A new command-line tool (om_algorithm) to get information about the available algorithms.
<LI>A new Maximum Entropy algorithm with two training methods: GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) and L-BFGS (Limited-Memory Variable Metric).
</UL>

<P>
The GARP Best Subsets algorithm was also changed to accept the "max threads" parameter, which can be used to speed up the modelling process in multi-processor machines.
</P>
<P>

</P>

<H2>Released version 0.5.3 of the library</H2>

<P>
Thursday, 24 April 2008
</P>
<P>
A new version of the openModeller library is available. This release (0.5.3) contains many bugfixes and a new algorithm called Aquamaps. The algorithms "minimum distance" and "distance to average" were removed since EnvironmentalDistance now provides the same functionality. The TerraLib drivers were updated for compatibility with TerraLib 3.2.0.  There are two new classes for pre-analysis on input layers to perform jackknife and chi-square (only available as library classes - their functionality still need to be exposed in the command-line and/or Desktop interfaces).  
</P>

<H2>openModeller Desktop version 1.0.6 Released</H2>

<P>
Friday, 26 October 2007
</P>
<P>
It is our great pleasure to announce the immediate availability of openModeller Desktop Version 1.0.6 is a generic framework for carrying out fundamental niche modelling experiments - typically used to predict species distribution given a set of environmental raster layers. The openModeller Desktop application builds on the openModeller library by providing a user friendly graphical user interface for carrying out niche modelling experiments.  
</P>
<P>
This release introduces several new features including:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Improved mapping capabilities - you can now specify occurrence symbol size and colour, and overlay a context layer (such as country boundaries) on your output map.
<LI>Experiments run in their own thread.- this makes for a more responsive user interface and you can look at completed models whilst the experiment is still running.
<LI>Web Service modelling improvements - improvement have been made to allow better job progress reporting when running as a web sevice.
<LI>Absence modelling is now supported - previous versions of openModellerDesktop did not handle absence data properly so absence modelling was not available.
<LI>GBIF Rest Data Fetcher (work sponsored by GBIF with our thanks!) - it is now possible to retrieve occurrence data using the new GIF Rest query service. The data fetcher has also had various cosmetic and useability improvements, and now functions as a wizard.
<LI>New algorithms - openModeller Desktop now ships with two new algorithms (Support Vector Machines and Bioclim Score).
<LI>Thresholding tool - you can now compute 'hotspot' models showing the predicted species count per cell by aggregating many model outputs into a single raster file. The threshold tool can also be used for 'concensus' modelling where many algorithms are used for a single species and all the resulting probability distribution maps are combined to provide a map indicating where most algorithms are in agreement that a species will ocurr at a given cell.
</UL>

<P>
The release also includes numerous improvements, bug fixes and stability improvements. openModeller Desktop is available in source form, and as binary executables for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu 7.10 GNU/Linux. All versions can be obtained from our <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=101808&amp;sel_platform=4998">download page</A>.

<H2>openModeller Desktop version 1.0.2 Released</H2>

<P>
Thursday, 14 December 2006
</P>
<P>
The openModeller team is pleased to announce version 1.0.2 of the openModeller Desktop graphical user interface for openModeller. This is the first public release of the new user interface which replaces the previous wizard based version. 
</P>

<H3>Main Features</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>A layerset manager</B>. This is for creating named collections of layers for use in modelling experiments. Having layers organised in named sets removes the tedium of repeatedly having to select layers from the file system for different model runs.
<LI><B>An algorithm profile manager</B>. Algorithm profiles let you store the custom parameters you use for running models in a reusable way.
An experiment designer. The experiment designer allows you to set up an experiment consisting of multiple species and algorithm profiles.
<LI><B>An experiment browser</B>. Once an experiment is completed the experiment browser presents the list of algorithm profiles and the species names in a tree view. Clicking on an item in the experiment tree shows a detailed report for that model. The report includes all the details of which algorithm was used, which parameters for the algorithm were changed, which layers were used, the model duration and so on.
<LI><B>A map browser</B>. The map browser allows you to pan and zoom on the model's map image.
<LI><B>Translations</B>. The openModeller Desktop application is available with Brazillian Portuguese and English translations.
<LI><B>Modelling Plugins</B>. The actual modelling work is managed by plugins. This release includes a 'local' plugin that uses the recent 0.4.0 openModeller library release, and a 'web service' plugin that allows models to be run on a remote server.* 
</UL>

<P>
* The web service plugin is still considered experimental. 
</P>

<H3>Availability</H3>

<P>
The software is available in source form (all platforms) and as a binary installer package for Microsoft Windows. In future releases we will make binaries available for Mac OSX and GNU/Linux. If you are an Ubuntu Linux user, step by step instructions for building the application on your system are available.

<H2>Released version 0.4 of the library</H2>

<P>
Wednesday, 06 December 2006
</P>
<P>
A new release of the openModeller library is now available. Version 0.4 contains major feature enhancements and also some bugfixes. This release includes integration with <A HREF="http://www.terralib.org/">TerraLib</A>, which is a complete framework for developing GIS tools. The main changes are: 
</P>

<UL>
<LI>In addition to GDAL, openModeller's IO functions now work with Terralib raster and point data.
<LI>Refactoring of the SOAP interface which now covers all modelling functionality, allowing remote interaction with a modelling service. The new version of GARP (v3) has been re-enabled.
<LI>The default output map file type was changed to ERDAS Imagine ".img" to achieve wider compatibility with GIS software. This format provides a floating-point representation in each raster cell (reflecting probability of presence). 
<LI>Several fixes in the SWIG-Python binding.
<LI>An installation issue with the RPM packages was fixed.
</UL>

<P>
The work has been funded by <A HREF="http://www.fapesp.br/">FAPESP</A>.

<H2>openModeller used in Cyclamen study</H2>

<P>
Wednesday, 20 September 2006
</P>
<P>
Chris Yesson and <A HREF="http://www.plantsci.rdg.ac.uk/staff/staffID=165">Alastair Culham</A> (University of Reading, UK) have published a phyloclimatic study on <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclamen">Cyclamen</A> a genus of popular garden plants. In the study they used openModeller (Bioclim) and <A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/">MaxEnt</A> to compute the climatic niche for members of this genus in past, present and future climates. The openModeller Desktop 'hotspot' tool was also used in the analysis. This tool will be generally available in the next version of openModeller Desktop! Full text of the article is available at the <A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/">BioMed Central Website</A>. The study also recieved mention in the <A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/20/nclimate120.xml">popular press</A>. Update: The study is discussed in a BBC Leading Edge radio show interview (it's right near the end). The aforementioned link needs Real Audio to be present on your computer.

<H2>Predicting habitat suitability with machine learning models</H2>

<P>
Tuesday, 29 August 2006
</P>
<P>
An article was recently published in Ecological Modelling describing
procedures used to model Pine forest distribution in Spain. The authors
used Grass and R to carry out the modelling process. openModeller was
not used but the article is still interesting for those involved in
ecological niche modelling. The complete article is available for
download as a pdf document.
</P>
<P>
<B>Abstract:</B> 
</P>
<P>
"We present a modelling framework for predicting forest areas. The
framework is obtained by integrating a machine learning software suite
within the GRASS Geographical Information System (GIS) and by providing
additional methods for predictive habitat modelling. Three machine
learning techniques (Tree-Based Classification, Neural Networks and
Random Forest) are available in parallel for modelling from climatic and
topographic variables. Model evaluation and parameter selection are
measured by sensitivity-specificity ROC analysis, while the final
presence and absence maps are obtained through maximisation of the kappa
statistic. The modelling framework is applied at a resolution of 1 km
with Iberian subpopulations of Pinus sylvestris L. forests. For this
data set, the most accurate algorithm is Breiman's random forest, an
ensemble method which provides automatic combination of tree-classifiers
trained on bootstrapped subsamples and randomised variable sets. All
models show a potential area of P. sylvestris for the Iberian Peninsula
which is larger than the present one, a result corroborated by regional
pollen analyses."

<H2>0.3.4 openModeller GUI available</H2>

<P>
Tuesday, 06 June 2006
</P>
<P>
A new version of the Windows build of openModeller Desktop GUI is
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=101808&amp;package_id=142057">available</A>. Note: This does not include the openModeller QGIS plugin for windows which will be made available in a future announcement.

<H2>Released version 0.3.3 of the library</H2>

<P>
Wednesday, 07 September 2005
</P>
<P>
This version includes a new serialization mechanism for the GARP Best Subsets Procedure, and it fixes some issues related to the Mac OS X build. A new release of the GUI should be following soon.
</P>

<H2>Major bugfix release 0.3.2</H2>

<P>
Thursday, 11 August 2005
</P>
<P>
An error during normalization offsets calculation was making DG_GARP and DG_GARP_BS produce null models most part of the time (100% omission on projected maps). Apparently the other algorithms were not affected. This problem was fixed on version 0.3.2 of both the library and the GUI. We recommend all users to upgrade.
</P>

<H2>Released version 0.3.1</H2>

<P>
Monday, 18 July 2005
</P>
<P>
Both the library and the GUI have been "co-released" under the same version number: 0.3.1. There were many changes in the library (code cleanup, bugfixes, new features and performance optimizations).
</P>
<P>
Changes to the library include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Reimplemented serialization/deserialization mechanism using generic configuration objects (all available algorithms are now serializable).
<LI>om_console accepts two new keywords "Output model" (file name to store the serialized model) and "Input model" (file name to load a serialized model instead of using "WKT format", "Species file", "Species" and "Map").
<LI>New framework for test cases available (depends on the SWIG/Python interface).
<LI>Moved normalization from the individual raster files to the "environment" object.
<LI>Implemented Model and Algorithm separation (new interface called Model abstracts the portion of Algorithm used for evaluations).
<LI>Implemented reference-counting smart pointers for all major objects.
<LI>Fixed various problems with memory leaks and uninitialized values.
<LI>Removed CSM Kaiser-Gutman from build.
<LI>Removed SWIG/Java binding from build.
<LI>Projected maps now have the mask extent and cell size of a specified "map format".
<LI>Major restructuring of directories, file locations and file names.
</UL>

<P>
Changes to the GUI include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Compatibility with the new library version.
<LI>Models are automatically serialized (XML file).
<LI>A new report is generated (and saved in HTML) after each modelling process.
</UL>

<H2>BDWorld using openModeller in a GRID environment</H2>

<P>
Saturday, 02 July 2005
</P>
<P>
Demonstration sessions during the BiodiversityWorld (BDWorld) GRID Workshop showed openModeller being used as a <A HREF="http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/~foster/Articles/WhatIsTheGrid.pdf">GRID</A> component. The workshop has been held at the National e-Science Centre in Edinburgh on June 30th and July 1st, 2005.  
</P>
<P>
BDWorld is developing an advanced GRID-based problem solving environment to facilitate scientific research in biodiversity informatics. Use cases may include modelling species distributions, conservation prioritization and study of evolutionary changes.  
</P>
<P>
BDWorld provides a flexible workflow interface based on <A HREF="http://www.trianacode.org/">Triana</A> with several pre-defined GRID components available. Components can be assembled in many different ways to build customized workflows and achieve the desired results.
