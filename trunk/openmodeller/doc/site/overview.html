Models are generated by an algorithm that receives as input a set of
occurrence points (latitude/longitude) and a set of environmental layer
files. It's being written in C++ ANSI with platform independence in
mind. It accepts different algorithms (now Bioclim and simple cartesian
distance algorithms, GARP, Climate Space Model, and in the near future
GAM, GLM, Neural Nets, etc). It uses GDAL to read several map file
formats and proj4 to convert between different georeferencing systems
and projections.

A client-server architecture will be used as a first approach, enabling
the existence of different client interfaces (desktop, command line and
web-based). In the future some tasks could be performed in a distributed
way, including the possibility of running separately the algorithms in
remote cluster machines. Its source code is available at sourceforge for
all interested developers.
