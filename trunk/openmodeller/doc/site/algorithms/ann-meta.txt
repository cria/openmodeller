The following images show models in the environmental space (temperature x precipitation) generated with the same input (<i>Thalurania furcata boliviana</i> localities dataset) by the Artificial Neural Networks algorithm (training by epochs). Green dots are presence points, red dots are pseudo-absences generated outside the respective bioclim model. The different models reflect the non-deterministic nature of the algorithm:
