NAME
       om_console - The command line front end to openModeller

DESCRIPTION
       om_console is a command line tool for running bioclimatic envelope 
       model analyses using the openModeller library. om_console requires 
       a 'request file' name to be passed to it as a parameter.

USAGE
       om_console <request file>

REQUEST FILE DESCRIPTION

  WKT Coord System - Coordinate system and projection in WKT format.for species file.
  e.g.   WKT Coord System = GEOGCS["WGS 84",DATUM ["WGS_1984", SPHEROID ["WGS84",6378137,298.257223563, AUTHORITY ["EPSG","7030"]], TOWGS84  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]], PRIMEM["Greenwich",0, AUTHORITY [  "EPSG","8901"]], UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433, AUTHORITY["EPSG","9108"]], AXIS["Lat",NORTH], AXIS["Long", EAST], AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]].


  Occurrences source - Full path and file name of the file containing localities data. e.g.  Species file = /home/user/sapointsclipped.txt

  Occurrences group - The taxon in the localities file to be modelled, defaults to the first 
  taxon found. e.g. Species = M spinosa

  Map - One or more Independent Variable Layers (map layers). Specify 
  additional layers using a 'Map =' prefix for each one. e.g. 
  Map = /home/user/wcape_demlam
  Map = /home/user/wcape_avmint

  Mask - A layer that specifies the region of interest for model building
  e.g. Mask = /home/user/wcape_demlam

  Model Output Settings:

  Output map - Map projection layers the model will be projected into the 
  environment represented in these layers. Note that the layers should be 
  of the same unit type, in the same order and should represent the same
  environmental parameter as teh associated layers in the input dataset.
  e.g.
  Output Map = /home/user/wcape_future_demlam
  Output Map = /home/user/wcape_future_avmint

  Output Mask - A layer that specifies the region of interest for model projection
  e.g. Output Mask = /home/user/mask

  Output model - Output file name for the serialised model
  e.g. Output model = /tmp/fboliviana.xml

  Output file - The filename for the model geotiff image  which should end in .tif
  e.g. Output file = /tmp/test.tif

  Output format - A layer that specifies the format (cell size and coordinate
  system) for the generated map
  e.g. Output Format = /home/user/wcape_demlam

  Model Type and Extra Model Parameters:

  Algorithm - Name of the algorithm used to construct the model. If you dont
  know the algorithm name, leave this tag out and you will be prompted
  so select an algorithm from a list.
  e.g. Algorithm = Bioclim

  Parameter - One or more parameters can be specified for the selected 
  algorothm. If you dont  know the parameter, leave this tag out (along with 
  the algorithm tab above) and you will be prompted to select an 
  parameters from a list.
  e.g. Parameter = StandardDeviationCutoff 0.674
