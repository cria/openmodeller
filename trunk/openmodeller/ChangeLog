Release 0.2.1 (2005-02-19)
--------------------------

	* Added DesktopGarp version of GARP (as GARP 2.1).
	* Removed GARP 3.x from build due to instability under high dimensional datasets.
	* Best Subset Procedure was substituted by a new generic version that can be extended to encapsulate any GARP version.
	* Fixed bug in Bioclim distance algorithm (probabilities were greater than zero outside the envelop depending on the cutoff parameter).
	* Fixed bug in sampler class: when absence data was available, it was splitting train samplers once again and test samplers were coming out empty.

Release 0.2 (2005-01-25)
------------------------

	* Compatibility with Windows.
	* Compatibility with Mac OS.
	* Fixed issues with GDAL 1.2.5.

Release 0.2-rc1 (2004-12-10)
----------------------------

	* GARP algorithm, including best subsets procedure.
	* CSM splitted into Kaiser-Gutman and Broken Stick cutoff methods.
	* Prototype SOAP interface.
	* SWIG interfaces for python and java.
	* Bioclim algorithm refactored and splitted in two implementations.
	* Prototype model serialization for most algorithms.
	* Reprojection capabilities.
	* New tool to visualize models in environmental space (only the first 2 variables).

Release 0.1.1 (2004-04-29)
--------------------------

	* Bugfix release: corrected problem of reading only the first algorithm's parameter.

Release 0.1 (2004-04-27)
------------------------

Features:
	
	* A simple command-line (console) interface. 
	* A driver to the GDAL library to read and write multiple map file formats. 
	* Capability to deal with multiple coordinate systems using the proj4 library. 
	* Two simple distance-based algorithms. 
	* Bioclim algorithm. 
	* Climate Space Model algorithm using Kaiser-Gutman cutoff.
