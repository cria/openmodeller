Release 0.4.1 (2007-03-12)
-----------------------------

	* New algorithm "Environmental Distance".
	* Changed OccurrencesReader to handle presence and absence points separately.
	* Changed occurrences file format (now TAB-delimited with each point having a unique identifier).
	* Initial support to cmake (should work on GNU/Linux and Mac OSX).

Release 0.4 (2006-12-04)
------------------------

        * Integration with TerraLib.
	* Removed the algorithm Bioclim distance.
	* Changed the default output map file type to ERDAS Imagine ".img".
	* Refactored SOAP interface which now covers all modelling functionality.
	* Re-enabled the new version of GARP (v3).
	* Several fixes in the SWIG-Python binding.
	* Fixed installation issue with the RPM packages.

Release 0.3.4 (2005-12-14)
--------------------------

        * Fixed bug in model projector that could cause localized distortions in the distribution map (near the grid cell scale).
	* New version of the CSM algorithm with several adjustments in code (Broken Stick cutoff method).
	* New command line tools om_sampledump, om_create, om_project.

Release 0.3.3 (2005-09-01)
--------------------------

        * Implemented serialization mechanism for the Best Subsets Procedure.
	* Moved the createModel logic and ModelCommand object into Algorithm.
	* Fixed issues related to the Mac OS X build (for both 10.3 and 10.4).

Release 0.3.2 (2005-08-11)
--------------------------

        * Fixed bug that was making GARP produce null models (100% omission) most part of the time.

Release 0.3.1 (2005-07-18)
--------------------------

	* Major restructuring of directories, file locations and file names.

Release 0.3 (planned to 2005-05-25, but never happened)
-------------------------------------------------------

	* Reimplemented serialization/deserialization mechanism using generic configuration objects.
	* All available algorithms are serializable.
	* om_console accepts new keywords "Output model" (file name to store the serialized model) and "Input model" to load a serialized model (instead of using "WKT format", "Species file", "Species" and "Map" to generate a model).
	* New framework for test cases is available (depends on the SWIG/Python interface).
	* Moved normalization from the individual raster files to the "environment" object.
	* Implemented Model and Algorithm separation (new interface called Model abstracts the portion of Algorithm used for evaluations).
	* Implemented reference-counting smart pointers for all major objects.
	* Fixed various problems with memory leaks and uninitialized values.
	* Removed CSM Kaiser-Gutman from build.
	* Removed SWIG/Java binding from build.
	* Projected maps now have the mask extent and cell size of a specified "map format".
	

Release 0.2.1 (2005-02-19)
--------------------------

	* Added DesktopGarp version of GARP (as GARP 2.1).
	* Removed GARP 3.x from build due to instability under high dimensional datasets.
	* Best Subset Procedure was substituted by a new generic version that can be extended to encapsulate any GARP version.
	* Fixed bug in Bioclim distance algorithm (probabilities were greater than zero outside the envelop depending on the cutoff parameter).
	* Fixed bug in sampler class: when absence data was available, it was splitting train samplers once again and test samplers were coming out empty.

Release 0.2 (2005-01-25)
------------------------

	* Compatibility with Windows.
	* Compatibility with Mac OS.
	* Fixed issues with GDAL 1.2.5.

Release 0.2-rc1 (2004-12-10)
----------------------------

	* GARP algorithm, including best subsets procedure.
	* CSM splitted into Kaiser-Gutman and Broken Stick cutoff methods.
	* Prototype SOAP interface.
	* SWIG interfaces for python and java.
	* Bioclim algorithm refactored and splitted in two implementations.
	* Prototype model serialization for most algorithms.
	* Reprojection capabilities.
	* New tool to visualize models in environmental space (only the first 2 variables).

Release 0.1.1 (2004-04-29)
--------------------------

	* Bugfix release: corrected problem of reading only the first algorithm's parameter.

Release 0.1 (2004-04-27)
------------------------

Features:
	
	* A simple command-line (console) interface. 
	* A driver to the GDAL library to read and write multiple map file formats. 
	* Capability to deal with multiple coordinate systems using the proj4 library. 
	* Two simple distance-based algorithms. 
	* Bioclim algorithm. 
	* Climate Space Model algorithm using Kaiser-Gutman cutoff.
