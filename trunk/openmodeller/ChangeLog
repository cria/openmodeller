Release 0.5.3 (?)
-----------------
SVN revision: ?

	* Fixed bug when GDAL failed to read a raster row (in which case the row used to have zero values). Now the row is filled with nodata values.

	* New prototype function to perform jackknifing in the environmental layers.
	* Changed nodata value of the default raster type (ByteHFA) to 101.
	* Masks must now use nodata to indicate masked areas (zeros will not work anymore).
	* om_testmodel now generates pseudo-absence points when there are no absences to be tested.
	* Display confusion matrix cell values in om_console and om_testmodel.
	* Renamed getLayerFilename to getLayerPath and getMaskFilename to getMaskPath in EnvironmentPtr class.
	* Refactored om_pseudo, om_create and om_project to use the getopts command line library.

--------------------------

	* Major restructuring of directories, file locations and file names.

Release 0.3 (planned to 2005-05-25, but never happened)
-------------------------------------------------------

	* Reimplemented serialization/deserialization mechanism using generic configuration objects.
	* All available algorithms are serializable.
	* om_console accepts new keywords "Output model" (file name to store the serialized model) and "Input model" to load a serialized model (instead of using "WKT format", "Species file", "Species" and "Map" to generate a model).
	* New framework for test cases is available (depends on the SWIG/Python interface).
	* Moved normalization from the individual raster files to the "environment" object.
	* Implemented Model and Algorithm separation (new interface called Model abstracts the portion of Algorithm used for evaluations).
