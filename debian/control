Description: openModeller is an open source C++ library to determine potential 
 distribution in environment and geographic space. Models are generated 
 by algorithms that receive as input a set of occurrence points 
 (latitude/longitude/abundance) and a set of raster files with environment
 data. Models can then be projected to generate distribution maps. 
 Available algorithms include Bioclim, GARP Best Subsets, Support Vector 
 Machines, Climate Space Model, Environmental Distance, and AquaMaps.
 The library uses GDAL to read different raster formats and proj4 to 
 convert between different coordinate systems and projections.

Description: Soap server for openModeller
 openModeller is an open source C++ spatial 
 distribution modelling library which is mainly being used to 
 predict species distribution (fundamental niche). 
 The openModeller server is a SOAP server that listens 
 for incoming modelling requests. It allows models to be run on 
 a remote server using a suitable client.
