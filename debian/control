Description:  openModeller is an open source C++ spatial 
 distribution modelling library which is mainly being used to 
 predict species distribution (fundamental niche). 
 Models are generated by algorithms that receive as 
 input a set of occurrence points (longitude/latitude/abundance) and a 
 set of raster files. Models can then be projected into different 
 environments (different sets of raster files) to generate distribution 
 maps. Available algorithms include Bioclim, GARP (with best subset 
 procedure), CSM (Climate Space Model), and cartesian distance algorithms. 
 New algorithms can easily be added. The library uses GDAL to read 
 different raster formats and proj4 to convert between different 
 coordinate systems and projections. A console interface is distributed 
 with the library, as well as a SWIG wrapper for the Python language and 
 a SOAP server prototype. The tool was originally developed by CRIA as 
 part of the speciesLink project (funded by Fapesp, the State of Sao 
 Paulo Research Foundation).

Description: Soap server for openModeller
 openModeller is an open source C++ spatial 
 distribution modelling library which is mainly being used to 
 predict species distribution (fundamental niche). 
 The openModeller server is a SOAP server that listens 
 for incoming modelling requests. It allows models to be run on 
 a remote server using a suitable client.
