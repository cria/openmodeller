1. Install proj4 library (www.remotesensing.org/proj).
   Note that openModeller was tested with version 4.4.7


2. Install the latest GDAL version. At this moment the stable version
   is 1.1.9 but it is better get the latest source from CVS:

   % export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.remotesensing.org:/cvsroot
   % cvs login
   Password: anonymous
   % cvs checkout gdal


3. Untar openModeller.tgz (if you downloaded the file instead of doing
   a cvs check out).


5. Go to $(OM_HOME) and do a "make". It will create a
   $(OM_HOME)/src/om_console executable.

   If you have X11 you can do a "make viewer". It will create a
   $(OM_HOME)/src/om_viewer executable. It is simple graphical
   interface to visualize the maps, models and occurrence points.


6. If you want to build the code documentation and have doxygen
   (www.doxygen.org) installed you do a "make documentation". It will
   create two documentation directories: $(OM_HOME)/doc/html and
   $(OM_HOME)/doc/latex


7. In $(OM_HOME) directory do a "make install" to install the
   executables and libraries in $(OM_INSTALL) directory.


8. Go to $(OM_HOME)/examples and get at least one map file to do a
   simple test: 
    $ wget http://openmodeller.cria.org.br/download/rain_coolest.tgz
    $ tar xvzf rain_coolest.tgz


9. Read the request.txt file. It tells openModeller what to do.


10. Run openModeller console version:
    $ om_console request.txt

    The output will be in furcata.tif.

    Obs: be sure that $(OM_INSTALL)/bin is in your PATH!


11. If you built om_viewer (step 5) you can:

    Visualize the maps with:
    $ om_viewer request.txt

    Visualize the resulted model with:
    $ om_viewer -r request.txt
