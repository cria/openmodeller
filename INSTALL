1. Install proj4 library (www.remotesensing.org/proj).
   Note that openModeller was tested with version 4.4.7


2. Install the latest GDAL version. At this moment the stable version
   is 1.1.9 but it is better get the latest source from CVS:

   % export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.remotesensing.org:/cvsroot
   % cvs login
   Password: anonymous
   % cvs checkout gdal


3. Untar openModeller.tgz (if you downloaded the file instead of doing
   a cvs check out).


4. Set the environment variables OM_HOME (to: bla/bla/openModeller)
   and, if necessary, GDAL_DIR. If you didn't change the "--prefix="
   parameter in "configure" when installing GDAL (the default is
  /usr/local) you don't need to set GDAL_DIR.


5. Go to $(OM_HOME) and do a "make". It will create a
   $(OM_HOME)/src/om_console executable.


6. If you want to build the code documentation and have doxygen
   (www.doxygen.org) installed you do a "make documentation". It will
   create two documentation directories: $(OM_HOME)/doc/html and
   $(OM_HOME)/doc/latex


7. Go to $(OM_HOME)/examples and get at least one map file do a simple
   test: 
    $ wget http://openmodeller.cria.org.br/download/rain_coolest.tgz
    $ tar xvzf rain_coolest.tgz


8. Read the request.txt file. It tells openModeller what to do.


9. Go to $(OM_HOME)/src and execute:
    $ om_console ../examples/request.txt

    The output will be in ../examples/furcata.tif.


10. If you have X11 you can:
    $ make om_viewer

    And visualize the maps with:
    $ om_viewer ../examples/request.txt

    And the resulted model with
    $ om_viewer -r ../examples/request.txt
