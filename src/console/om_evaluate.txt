NAME
     om_evaluate - return model values given a set of points and an environmental scenario using the openModeller framework

SYNOPSIS
       om_evaluate [-] v --version | r --xml-req FILE | o --model FILE p --points FILE  [ s --result FILE ] [ --log-level LEVEL ] [ --log-file FILE ] [ --prog-file FILE ]

DESCRIPTION
       om_evaluate is a command line tool to return raw model values given a set of points and an environmental scenario. There are two ways of providing input: one is to specify an XML file containing a request according to the ModelEvaluationParameters element definition in the openModeller XML Schema located in http://openmodeller.cria.org.br/xml/2.0/openModeller.xsd (the test_request.xml file in the openModeller examples directory can also be used with om_evaluate, although the root element name is related to the test operation) and the other is to specify a file with a serialized model according to the SerializedModel element definition in the openModeller XML Schema together with another file with the points to be tested (TAB-delimited, following the same pattern used to specify points in text files for om_console). When providing a serialized model and a file with points to be tested, these points must have the same spatial reference and label as the training points that can be found in the serialized model. In this case, the layers used during the test will also be the same ones used to create the model. Results will be either displayed on the screen or stored in another file if the corresponding parameter was specified. The result will be in XML, following the ModelEvaluationType definition in the openModeller XML Schema. Serialized models can be generated with om_console or om_model. When a point does not have the complete environmental values (one or more layer has no data), model evaluation returns -1.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version     Display version info.

       -r, --xml-req     File containing a test request in XML.

       -o, --model       File containing a serialized model in XML.

       -p, --points      File containing the points to be tested.

       -s, --result      File where the test result will be stored.

       --log-level       openModeller log level: debug, warn, info or error. Defaults to "info".

       --log-file        File to store log information.

       --prog-file       File to store progress (-1=queued, -2=aborted, -3=cancelled, [0,100]=progress).

       -c, --config-file Configuration file for openModeller (available since version 1.4).
