/**

Herewith follows a detailed explanation of the Enivironmental Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA). 
This implementation of ENFA was written by Chris Yesson using the openmodeller cpp code for the CSM algorithm by Tim Sutton as a code foundation and the Matlab implentation of ENFA written by Derek Tittensor as a logical guide.

BACGROUND DATA NORMALISATION

% Calculate background mean, std, and covariance

% Standardise the background data matrix following Hirzel et al. (2002)

% Estimate the global covariance matrix (for non-NaN data only)
% use the pseudo-absence generator to get a sample of background points
% this sample could theoretically be every background point by setting
% a high numpoints and tweaking the threshold too.

% Calculate the covariance matrix for the species only environmental data

% RUN THE ENFA

% calculate species means
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
m = mean(speclocegvs);
z = cov_species^-0.5 * m';
y = z / sqrtm(z' * z);

W = cov_species^-0.5 * cov_global * cov_species^-0.5;
H = (eye(no_egvs) - y * y') * W * (eye(no_egvs) - y * y');

[v, eigenvalues] = eig(H);
eigenvalues = diag(eigenvalues);

% OK, we have a problem here in that one eigenvalue is non-zero (negative?)
% but it's not immediately clear which one.
t = eigenvalues ~= min(eigenvalues);
eigenvalues(2:no_egvs) = eigenvalues(t);
eigenvalues(1) = trace(W) - trace(H)

% Figure out which eigenvalue has gone AWOL
u = cov_species^-0.5 * v;
u_orig = u;

% OK, now replace the first column with m
u(:,2:no_egvs) = u(:,t);
u(:,1) = m';

% Now norm u
for ii = 1:no_egvs
    u(:,ii) = u(:,ii) / norm(u(:,ii));
end

% Remember that signs are unimportant for every factor 
% except the first
score_matrix = u

% Calculate global marginality
marginality = sqrt(sum(m.^2));
marginality = marginality / 1.96

% Calculate global specialization
specialization = sqrt(sum(eigenvalues)/length(m))
factor_weights = eigenvalues / sum(eigenvalues);

The next step is to remove unwanted components either by specifying the number to retain, keeping those that sum to a specified level of variation, or by comparison to the broken stick distribution.

That complete the ENFA model definition

% HABITAT_SUITABILITY_GEO - A function to calculate and plot habitat 
% suitability from ENFA results. Uses the geometric mean algorithm
% described in Hirzel & Arlettaz (2003)
% 
% INPUTS: 
% score_matrix -    The score matrix from the ENFA
% no_factors -      Number of factors to be used in the analysis
% (following broken stick advice)
% factor_weights -  Weights to give to each factor
% varmat        -   A matrix of EGV data (each column one EGV)
% specloc       -   The EGV locations (rows) with species
% observations
% no_egvs       -   The number of EGVs
%
% NOTE THAT hsmap_specs MUST BE A SINGLE COLUMN VECTOR OF SPECIES LOCATIONS
%

function final_hs = habitat_suitability(score_matrix, no_factors, factor_weights, hsmap_egvs, hsmap_specs, no_egvs)

% Create vectors to hold results
geo_mean = zeros(length(hsmap_egvs),1);
hs = zeros(length(hsmap_egvs),1);
temp_egvs = zeros(length(hsmap_egvs),no_factors);
temp_spec = zeros(length(hsmap_specs),no_factors);

% Convert EGVs and species locations to
% factor axes by multiplying by columns of 
% the score matrix (this gives identical results to Biomapper)
for ii = 1:no_factors
    temp_egvs(:,ii) = hsmap_egvs(:,3:no_egvs + 2) * score_matrix(:,ii);
end

% Create a matrix holding the factor-converted species data
temp_spec = temp_egvs(hsmap_specs,:);

% Use only the weights for the factors that we are using
weights = factor_weights(1:no_factors)'

weights = weights ./ sum(weights);

% Now calculate the geometric mean of points P in the
% environmental space to all species observation points
% Loop through locations
for ii = 1:length(temp_egvs)
    dist = zeros(length(temp_spec),1);
    % Look through locations with species
    for jj = 1:length(temp_spec);
        % Calculate Euclidian distance
        
        disttemp = (temp_egvs(ii,:) - temp_spec(jj,:)).^2;
        disttemp = weights .* disttemp;
        dist(jj) = sqrt(sum(disttemp));
    end

    
    % MATLAB has a built in geometric mean function
    % Note that we exclude points with a distance of zero
    % otherwise function gives a result of zero
    %geo_mean(ii) = geomean(dist(dist~=0));
    geo_mean(ii) = prod(dist(dist~=0));
    geo_mean(ii) = geo_mean(ii)^(1 / length(dist));
   
end

% Extract the geometric means of all the species observation points
species_geomeans = geo_mean(hsmap_specs);


% OK, now to convert these into habitat suitability values.
% Determine what percentage of the species presence points
% are further away from zero

% Loop through the geometric mean distances
for ii = 1:length(geo_mean)
    % Find out how many observed points are further away
    hs(ii) = length(find(species_geomeans >= geo_mean(ii)));
end

% Now convert to habitat suitability by dividing through
% by the number of species presence points and multiplying by 100
final_hs = (hs / length(species_geomeans)) * 100;
