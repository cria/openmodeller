The openModeller Web Service (OMWS) interface was created to 
provide programatic access to niche modelling services over the web. 

There are two versions of the API: 1.0 and 2.0. Although most 
operations are the same, there's no backwards compatibility due 
to a change in the namespace. Therefore, make sure you use the right 
client version when interacting with a server.

You can find more information about the OMWS API and the corresponding
software inside each directory (web_service.t2t and om_server.t2t).

OMWS is based on SOAP. The server implementation uses gSOAP v2.8.15
(http://gsoap2.sourceforge.net) and has only been tested with
GNU/Linux running as a CGI.

A command line client in Perl is also available (sampleClient.pl,
which depends on SOAP::Lite version >= 0.67).

You can find the corresponding implementations for both client and 
server under each version directory.
