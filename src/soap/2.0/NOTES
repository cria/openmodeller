- To change anything in the OMWS interface it is necessary
  to have gSOAP installed. The API is defined in omws_api.hh.

- To generate the SOAP stubs and skeletons for the service use:
 
  soapcpp2 -p omws -q omws omws_api.hh

- If you are upgrading gSOAP, don't forget to overwrite 
  stdsoap2.cpp and stdsoap2.h with the newer versions.
  They have to be manually copied to this directory.

- To activate server debug logging, uncomment the line
  #define DEBUG in stdsoap2.h and recompile the server.

- Changes in the openModeller XML Schema are done manually
  in the file openModeller.xsd, and they may impact the library
  used to read and write openModeller XML content. This library
  is used by omws_manager.cpp

- To generate the library for reading and writing openModeller
  XML content, make a backup of om.nsmap and then:

  wsdl2h -d -g -t om.nsmap -q om -N "om" openModeller.xsd

  soapcpp2 -L -S -w -x -0 -p om -q om -I /usr/local/src/gsoap-2.8/gsoap/import/ openModeller.h

  soapcpp2 -p env env.h

  note: you will need to restore om.nsmap after that, as it gets 
        rewritten in one of these steps.
