Release 1.6.0 (?)

SVN revision: ?

	* Fixed two bugs in the consensus algorithm: it was not calculating LPT for each individual algorithm and not normalizing the environmental variables for algorithms that required normalization. With these two bugs, consensus only worked when individual models were generated outside it, assembled and provided as XML, otherwise it only worked when the real LPT coincided with the default value (1) for all individual algorithms and when none of them required normalization. 


--------------------------
Release 1.5.0 (2015-01-07)

	* New algorithm to generate virtual niches.
	* Fixed bug in the web service when checking the origin of remote rasters.

Release 1.4.0 (2014-03-31)

SVN revision: 5955

	* New CONSENSUS algorithm that can be used to generate models with different algorithms by converting each individual model into a binary model given a threshold and then "merging" them into a final combined model according to a specified level of agreement.
	* Upgraded gSOAP version being used by OMWS to 2.8.15.
	* Included library API versioning, starting with 0 from this release.
	* Moved some of the compiler definitions from CMake to internal #defines, so that client programs can include openModeller headers without worrying about adding specific definitions if they want to compile directly without using CMake.
	* New command-line tool om_evaluate to return raw model values given a set of points and an environmental scenario.
	* Fixed segfault when needNormalization was called on a deserialized SVM algorithm.
	* Modified om_pseudo command-line tool to also accept XML input (in this case also producing XML output), optionally storing it into a file. When a model is specified as a parameter, presences are generated inside the model, while absences are generated outside.
	* New implementation of the SOAP client/server programs compatible with OMWS 2.0.
	* New driver to fetch remote rasters available through http, https or ftp. Layers can now be identified by URLs.
	* New class to read openModeller settings from a configuration file (key = value). Possible configurations include: CACHE_DIRECTORY, ALGS_DIRECTORY and DATA_DIRECTORY.
	* Changed initialization priority order for paths: 1) programatic setting, 2) configuration file, 3) environment variable, 4) default value through compiler constant.
	* Renamed compiler constant PKGDATAPATH and environment variable OM_DATA_PATH to OM_DATA_DIR.
	* Renamed compiler constant PLUGINPATH and environment variable OM_ALG_PATH to OM_ALGS_DIR.
	* New optional parameter --config-file in most command line tools to indicate a configuration file for openModeller: om_model, om_test, om_project, om_points, om_pseudo, om_evaluate, om_sampler and om_algorithm. om_console also accepts an optional third argument to specify the configuration file location.
	* New command-line tool om_layer to either check if a specified layer id can be read from openModeller or to recursively scan a specified directory looking for openModeller-compatible layers.
	* New configuration FETCH_WCS (true or false) allowing WCS rasters to be fetched and stored as local Erdas Imagine copies before being used.

	* Compilation now requires CMake 2.6.4.
	* New algorithm Random Forests.
	* Web service interface now accepts a new optional parameter specifying the prediction threshold to be used when calculating area statistics during projection.
	* Renamed envelope element in the getProjectionMetadata response of the web service API to distinguish it from the subelement.
	* Added control to a maximum number of concurrent jobs on the modelling server.
