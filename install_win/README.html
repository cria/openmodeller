<p><h1>openModeller Introduction</h1></p>

<p><i>Note: This document is <b>not</b> intended to be a
    replacement for the manual pages nor for the documentation available
    in openModeller website. Instead, this is a quick introduction on
    how to generate a model using the CLI (command line interface) tools
    available on every openModeller distribution.</i></p>

<p>You have just installed openModeller. Here you'll find some
instructions to get you into the basics on how to generate a simple
model using the command-line interface tools available.</p>

<h2>openModeller Modularity</h2>

<p>openModeller itself isn't a standalone software. It's a modular
software, in which many parts work together to generate its
functionality. A simplified model of openModeller structure is shown
below:</p> 

<p><center><img src="openModeller.jpg"></center></p><br>

<p>There are different ways to use its core modelling functionality.  If
you are interested in a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons,
controls and images you should download a different package called <a
    href="http://openmodeller.sourceforge.net/index.php?Itemid=5&id=10&option=com_content&task=view">openModeller
    Desktop</a>. Instead, if you want to use the CLI interface,
openModeller offers some specific tools (commands) to use all the
funcionality the GUI offers (and sometimes, even more). The point
here is that you can effectively use openModeller in a variety of
ways.</p>

<p>Now, let's get our hands dirt.</p>

<h2>Generating a model</h2>

<p><i>Note: This document focuses on the Windows platform to show how to
    use a terminal, however, this should just apply for any other
    platforms as well.</i></p>

<p>In Windows, the <i>terminal</i> is the <i>Command prompt</i>, the
MS-DOS prompt. Starting from openModeller 1.3.0, installer includes
shortcuts to all the commands available. When you click in one of these
shortcuts, a new terminal is opened called <i>openModeller
    Terminal</i>, which is basically a standard <i>Command prompt</i>,
with a usage help that shows the options to effectively use the
command.</p>

<p>The openModeller Terminal starts in the <i>Working Folder</i>
specified at the installation. In its inside, there is a folder called
<i>examples</i>, which we'll use to run our... example.</p>

<p>From now on, we make some assumptions here. The commands you should
type will be in <b>bold</b>, while the rest of the
<code>monospaced</code> font is the output from the terminal itself
and/or openModeller. Also, we assume the <i>Working Folder</i> to be
<code>C:\om</code>.</p> 

<p>So, let's enter the examples directory:</p>

<p><code>
    C:\om> <b>cd examples</b><br>
    C:\om\examples>
</code></p>

<p>Now we will issue the command to generate a model itself. Here,
as a matter of the example, we'll use a simple algorithm (faster)
and also the default parameters of openModeller for the chosen
algorithm.</p>

<p>The model was generated.</p>

<p>The <code>request.txt</code> file contains many definitions that
<code>om_console</code> use to generate its model. For instance,
<i>Map</i> specifies the layers it uses, <i>Output file</i> is the file
generated, and so on. You can modify this file to fit your own needs, or
you can generate a completely different one.</p>

<h2>Visualizing the model</h2>

<p>In the previous example, <i>Output file</i> is defined as <i>furcata.img</i>. You can
use <i>foo</i> to visualize the model just generated. Alternatively, you
can...</p>
