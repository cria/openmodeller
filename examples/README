          Using the openModeller examples:
                  Tim Sutton 2005
-----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains examples to demonstrate how the 
various om_* command line tools can be used. They use the 
simplest case scenario of a bioclim model with a single
environmental layer - subsequently the models produced 
themselves are not particularly robust or interesting. Rather
the idea is that you examine the configuration files provided
and available parameters to decide how to prepare your own 
models.

Note 1: If you are using these tools on Windows, you may first
want to add the openModeller installation directory in your
"Path" environment variable so that you can run them from 
anywhere. In this case, you should also set another 
environment variable called "OM_ALG_PATH" pointing to the 
absolute path of the "alg" subdirectory, otherwise 
openModeller will fail to load the algorithms.

Note 2: Since the configuration files provided (request.txt, 
model_request.xml and projection_request.xml) have references 
to other files, when using them you should run the 
command-line tools from inside the "examples" directory.

---

1) om_console

om_console takes a simple text file as listed in request.txt

e.g.

om_console request.txt

---

2) om_viewer

If you have built with X11 support you can use the om_viewer 
program to visualise the distribution map generated by 
openModeller:

e.g.

om_viewer -r request.txt

Or visualise the maps that were used to build the model:

e.g.

om_viewer request.txt

---

3) om_niche

If you have built with X11 support, and if your experiment has only 
two input layers, you can use the om_niche program to visualise the 
model as a graphic showing probabilities in the environmental space.

e.g.

om_niche request.txt

---

4) om_sampledump

When openmodeller creates a model, it fetches the values
through each of the climate layers. This is known as a sample. The
sample at each presence (or absence) point can be obtained using 
the om_sampledump application. This is useful if you want to under-
stand the actual data being used to build the model.

e.g.

om_sampledump request.txt outputfile.txt

---

5) om_create

This program uses the newer XML format for describing how a model
should be built. The output is another XML file which contains
the serialised model. No projection (mapping) of the model is 
carried out (see om_project below). This is useful if you wish
to create a model and project it into numerous climate scenarios.
om_console can produce a simlar result using the 'Output model'
instruction in the request file. om_create is a wholly XML 
approach to this.

e.g.

om_create --xml-req model_request.xml --model-file acacia-model.xml

(acacia-model.xml is the output model file)

Additional parameters and detailed documentation can be found in the
corresponding man page, or just by typing om_create without parameters.
---

6) om_test

This program can be used to perform external tests in models. The
input can be either a specific XML request for testing a model, or
a serialized model and a file with the points to be tested. 
The output is another XML file which contains the test result.

e.g.

om_test --xml-req test_request.xml

or

om_test --model-file acacia_model.xml --points-file test_points.xml

(acacia-model.xml is the same file generated by the om_create example)

Additional parameters and detailed documentation can be found in the
corresponding man page, or just by typing om_test without parameters.

---

7) om_project

This program is used to project a serialised model into an 
environment scenario. The output will be an image showing 
a probability surface.

The first parameter points to an XML file that describes how the
projection should be built. Note that there must be a match 
between each layer used to originally build the model and each 
layer in the projection environment:

 Create Model           Project Model
 ------------------------------------
 temp             |     temp
 rainfall         |     rainfall
 etc              |     etc

The second parameter specifies the name of the distribution map 
that will be generated. Optional statistics file and log file
can be saved as well.

e.g.

om_project --xml-req projection_request.xml --disp-map furcata.img

Additional parameters and detailed documentation can be found in the
corresponding man page, or just by typing om_project without parameters.

---

8) om_algorithm

This program can be used to get more information about the available 
algorithms.

e.g.

om_algorithm --list

Additional parameters and detailed documentation can be found in the
corresponding man page, or just by typing om_algorithm without parameters.

---

9) om_points

This program can be used to read occurrence data from a specified source
and return it as tab-delimited or XML content. 

e.g.

om_points --source http://data.gbif.org/ws/rest/occurrence/list --name "Physalis peruviana"

Additional parameters and detailed documentation can be found in the
corresponding man page, or just by typing om_points without parameters.

---

10) om_pseudo

This program can be used to generate pseudo occurrences.

e.g.

om_pseudo --num-points 20 --mask rain_coolest.tif

Additional parameters and detailed documentation can be found in the
corresponding man page, or just by typing om_pseudo without parameters.
